How to Use Scripts in Roblox on iOS (iPhone) in 2025
In this project, I will explain how to install and use scripts in Roblox so that you can become the best at any game.

1. Install a Script Executor
To use scripts on Roblox, you will need a script executor.

Recommended Executor for iOS:
Arceus X Neo

Download the iOS version (the file should be .ipa).

You will need a tool to install the .ipa file for your executor.
Not Free (Highly Recommended):
Signulous - $20 USD for a 1-year subscription
It will last for an entire year.
Free:
Scarlet - Free, but the installation will last for 24 to 48 hours.
Once youâ€™ve chosen your method, upload the .ipa file and install the app.

2. Get the Arceus X Neo Key
After installing Arceus X Neo, it will ask you for a key. To get the key:

Click on Get Key.
Paste the link into your browser and follow the steps to complete the process.
Once done, Arceus X Neo should be ready to use.

3. Have Fun!
Now that Arceus X Neo is installed and ready, open the app, and you should have access to various hacks like:

Custom speed
Jump power
Gravity manipulation
Aimbot
And many more!
Using Specific Scripts:

Search for the script online or pick one from my GitHub repository.
Copy the script code and paste it into the executor.
Execute the script, and you're ready to go!
